<p style="color:black;">Hi, my name is Elea Hustler, and I’m a student at El Camino High School in Oceanside. I’m really interested in web design and love learning how to create cool projects online. Outside of school, I stay active by playing waterpolo and swimming, and I also enjoy camping with friends. I spend a lot of time at the beach, watching sunsets, listening to music, and just hanging out with people I care about. I’m passionate about nature, good food, and exploring new places.&nbsp; These experiences inspire me every day, and they help me balance school, sports, and creativity.</p>
