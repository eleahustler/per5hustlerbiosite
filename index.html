<p style="color:black;">On this page, I used the HTML to create the structure, to make a header, nav, main content area, and footer. I created a background around the title and changed the colors of the texts. I also put a gif, made the buttons linked to the other pages, and made the buttons change colors when you hover over them. I also created a hero section built with divs. I made an embedded css page. I made 3 columns and put a border around them and changed the background color. &nbsp;</p>

<p style="color:black;">Hi, my name is Elea Hustler, and I’m a student at El Camino High School in Oceanside. I’m really interested in web design and love learning how to create cool projects online. Outside of school, I stay active by playing waterpolo and swimming, and I also enjoy camping with friends. I spend a lot of time at the beach, watching sunsets, listening to music, and just hanging out with people I care about. I’m passionate about nature, good food, and exploring new places.&nbsp; These experiences inspire me every day, and they help me balance school, sports, and creativity.</p>
